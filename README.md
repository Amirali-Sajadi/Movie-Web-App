# Movie Explorer WebApp

Movie Explorer WebApp is a React-based movie discovery application that lets users explore films using live data from [TMDB (The Movie Database)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Built with React and styled using CSS, it provides a clean, responsive interface for browsing popular, top-rated, and trending movies, as well as viewing detailed information about each title.
